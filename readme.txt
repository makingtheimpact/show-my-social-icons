== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I display the icons? =

You can display the icons in the main menu, widget areas, header, footer, or anywhere in your content using Gutenberg blocks, widgets, or shortcodes.

= How do I use the shortcodes? =

Use `[show_my_social_icons]` to display all icons, or `[my_social_icon platform="facebook"]` to display a single icon.

= Can I customize the appearance of the icons? =

Yes, you can customize the size, style, alignment, and colors of the icons through the plugin settings and shortcode/block attributes.

= What's the difference between SVG and PNG icons? =

SVG icons are scalable without loss of quality, while PNG icons have a fixed resolution. SVG icons are also smaller in file size for simple icons, but not supported by all browsers (especially older ones). PNG icons are supported by all browsers, but may pixelate when enlarged beyond 500px.

= How do I troubleshoot the CSS styles not being loaded? =

If the CSS styles are not being loaded, you can try the following:

1. Check the "Force Load Styles" option in the settings.
2. Clear the website cache and if necessary, adjust the settings. 
3. Clear the browser cache.

= How do I troubleshoot the icons not displaying? =

If the icons are not displaying, you can try the following:

1. Ensure the platform URL is set correctly in the settings.
2. Check the settings for the blocks and widgets to ensure they are set to the correct options.
